# Abstract
*The abstract is a brief summary of the report and contains the scope, motivation, results, the meaning of the results and the conclusion. The abstract is the first thing a person will read in your report. It is important to present the information in a clear, succinct manner to entice the viewer into reading your report.*

# Introduction

*The introduction can be treated as a sequence of sub sections containing a scope, motivation, aim, objective and anticipated benefits. The intention is to present the problem to be solved and the motivation behind the problem. The scope defines what will be covered in the study.*

# Method

*The method explains how you did the experiment or study in sufficient detail that the experiment can be reproduced. Diagrams, schematics and pseudo code are often included. It is not to be written as a step by step guide.*

# Results

*The results section should state the results and the important details of the experiment. This section often contains tables and graphs of the collected data. If the experiment was to compare simulated results against real life then graphs with both results on the same axis would be useful here. *

# Discussion

*The discussion section should explain the results and the position taken on the experiment. For example, why was the finish of the printed object stringy? How could the finish be improved? Comparisons against previous studies can be discussed here*.

# Conclusion

*This section should state what was found, why it is important, possible benefits and the position the experiment takes.*
