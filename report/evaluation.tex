\chapter{Evaluation}\label{C:eval}
% The purpose of the evaluation section is to demonstrate whether you did
% or did not satisfy the project goals or specifications.
% If you can tie the performance of your design to some real specification then
% your evaluation is much stronger. “My code runs in 29 ms” is much weaker than
% “my code runs within the 30 ms window allowable for real-time performance of the. . . ”.
%
% In many cases the evaluation of a project requires significant extra work to design and build test harnesses.
% These should be explained so that the validity and scope of the evaluation can be understood.
% Make liberal use of graphs and other figures.
% They are much more effective at communicating many results than are words.
