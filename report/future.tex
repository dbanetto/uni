\chapter{Future Work}\label{C:future}
% Future work should not just be a list of things that you
% would have done if you had a little more time.
% Talk about new things that are possible now that you have finished your project.
% What projects could a â€™489 student tackle next year if they started from your end point?

\section{Loop Invariant duplicate detection}
% this could be in the form of lexical, AST, logical equivalence

\section{Expanding Loop Invariant Generators}
% There is more loop patterns that could be used to generate loop invariants
% Not all possible cases are covered by the current implementations

\section{Visitor Pattern Compiler Pattern in Whiley}
% Current implementations of Generators have cloned structures
% Code duplication could be reduced by using Visitor Pattern
%  * decreases maintenance cost
%  * makes adding new syntax / AST nodes easier

\section{Whiley Pattern Language}
% Regular Expressions for Whiley
