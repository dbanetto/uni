## A)

A host-based intrusion detection (IDS) system is specialised software layer that detects
intrusions via a range of methods such as anomaly detection of local resource usage,
signature detection of known attack patterns and heuristics of the system.
A network-based intrusion detection system uses similar techniques as host-based IDS to
detect issues on the network. 
The main difference between the two systems is that a network based IDS needs
to handle all traffic going through it so that finding patterns between anomalies 
is a computational and data heavy task. Where a host-based IDS focuses on the single machine
it is monitoring to discover potential intrusions.


## B)

A false positive is when a heuristic based test says it has passed but when
tested again with a thorougher test that is certain in its result shows it to be
fail.
An example of this for a IDS such as a network-based one would be wrongfully detecting
a new sequence of packets to be an attack where in fact it was a new protocol developed
in-house.
A false negative  is similar to a false positive but the heuristic wrongfully
decides that it fails when the certain test says it should pass.
An example of this for a IDS such as a network-based one would be wrongfully detecting
that an attack is instead normal network usage.
