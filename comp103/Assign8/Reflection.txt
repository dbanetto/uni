For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got on this assignment. If there was a problem you got stuck on what was that problem?

* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.


----------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment I got up to and completed the Challenge section, expect calculateLocation(). There was
no major problems with completing this assignment.

The tree is displayed differently because the stack that holds the children's order
is not the same for each re-load of the taxonomy.

NOTE: Assuming inSubtree(...) is referring contains(...).

The main concern with the node being moved into a child of itself is that
it and its children will no longer be referenced in the main tree. The other
problem would be a loop will form the sub-tree, from the node that it was attached
to the "root".
