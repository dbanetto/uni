<!-- 
Aim for the case study:
    * recommend ways to improve egineering projects success

Using the view point of _legal compliance_

Areas to look at:
    * community engagement, communications
        * videos releases
        * large documents
        * how is this protected by law [find law, probably resouce management act & report section]
    * irreproducible selection process
        * How is this protected by law [find law, probably resouce management act & report section]
    * did not explore the impacts of their project

# Background
<!--
Describe the case or situation being investigated.
Focus on the facts of the situation.

 - it is a sub-project of the Wellington Corridor Project
 - improving the basin reserve area
 - The project was terminated in the proposal phase

 - notice of requirement, what is it?
 - proposal sent to EPA
 - goal of the RMA is to `promote the sustainable management of natural & physical resources`.

 - this was due to multiple failures to meet the requirements of the RMA
 - the area is a hertiage site, including the circket grounds, etc.

The Basin Reserve flyover was a proposed solution to alleviate the congestion between Wellington City, New Zealand,
and the eastern suburbs of Wellington.
Its proposed changes were primarily to add a flyover bridge from the Mt. Victoria tunnel to the
National War Memorial Park underpass [@basin_options_summary], see figure 1 for more detail.
These changes are to improve westward traffic heading to the motorway.
This project was one component of a greater project to improve the transport of Wellington region [@northern_corridor],
the Wellington Northern Corridor project.
These projects were managed by the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) [@treasury_exp_2016],
the transport arm of the New Zealand Government.

A flyover at the Basin Reserve was not the only option open to the NZTA to choose [@basin_options_report].
They had a range of options with three main themes: a flyover based approach ; a reconfiguration of the
street layout at the Basin Reserve ; and, a tunnel off to the side of the Basin [@basin_options_report].
Each option was tested against how well they alleviate the vehicle traffic of all use cases through
the Basin Reserve as well as promoting pedestrians and cyclists to easily move through the area.
A key metric used was to check the improvements of East-West and North-South traffic flow without
putting any of the services dependent on the Basin Reserve at a disadvantage, such as the Wellington Central Hospital to the
south and the schools to the east and south.

The Basin Reserve area includes a range of heritage sites and even the grounds
itself is a registered heritage area since 1998 [@basin_heritage].
Other heritage sites around the Basin Reserve that would be impacted include
Government House, official residence of the Governor General of New Zealand,
and the Home of Compassion Cr√®che, New Zealand's first dedicated child day-care centre [@creche].
These heritage sites have continually been vocally protected by community since the 1960's and today
with the 'Save the Basin' group [@basin_heritage][@save_basin].

The Basin Reserve flyover failed during the proposal phase of the project.
It failed to meet the standards of a Notice of Requirement (NOR) of the resources it needs to complete the project.
A Notice of Requirement is a process set out in the Resource Management Act that air marks the resources 
for the project, such as land, while a decision about the proposal is being made by authorities,
such as the local council or the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) [@rma_nor].
In this case it was handled by the EPA since the Basin Flyover is classified to be of national significance since
it is apart of the Wellington Northern Corridor project [@rma_nor][@basin_options_report].
The project failed the NOR due to a range of failings from not adequately mitigating impact on the amenity and heritage
of the Basin Reserve area and having an unclear rational in choosing a flyover over the
other options [@basin_options_report][@epa_report_judgement].

# Discussion
<!--
 - this was due to multiple failures to meet the requirements of the RMA
    - subset of these failtuers are: alteratives & hertiage site

    - alternatives 
        - "methodology,  particularly  the  need  for transparency and replicability, is important" [1273]
        - "it was not clear how criteria were weighted and the reason for any weighting.
           This made the process somewhat confusing and difficult to follow.  
           It also meant that the process could not be replicated" [1274]
        - section: 171(1) Whether adequate consideration has been given to alternative sites, routes & methods

        - highlights the requirement of transprancy when using finite resources like Land, city space, culture, anemity

    - hertiage sites
        - section 6(f) recongise & provide for protection of historic heritage from inappropriate development
        - public outcry tipped the balance & defended the Basin
        - King Salmon, case applied to '*inappropriate* development' 
        - test-cricket status of the Basin Reserve venue [1259]

         - highlights the importance of history and the community support for the site
