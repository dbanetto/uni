\chapter{Evaluation}\label{C:eval}
% The purpose of the evaluation section is to demonstrate whether you did
% or did not satisfy the project goals or specifications.
% If you can tie the performance of your design to some real specification then
% your evaluation is much stronger. “My code runs in 29 ms” is much weaker than
% “my code runs within the 30 ms window allowable for real-time performance of the. . . ”.
%
% In many cases the evaluation of a project requires significant extra work to design and build test harnesses.
% These should be explained so that the validity and scope of the evaluation can be understood.
% Make liberal use of graphs and other figures.
% They are much more effective at communicating many results than are words.

% TODO: do this
The evaluation of this project is to study reduction of required loop
invariants.
To measure the reduction a sizable code base that is also formally verifiable
is required to test against.
Currently the largest known code is the Whiley Compiler test suite.
The body of code will be filtered down to examples that contain loop
invariants for experiments.
These studies include checking how closely the generated invariants match
user given invariants,
what percentage of the loop invariants have been generated
and if the loop invariant are required.
From these studies the impact of generating simple loop invariants on
the proof obligations of the user can be accessed.

\section*{4. Future Plan}
% This should highlight the main components which remain to be done,
% and provide a proposed time-line in which this will happen. In putting together a time
% line, students must take into account upcoming examinations, coursework deadlines
% and other disruptions.

There are a range of improvements and additions that could be completed in
the time remaining of this project.
There could be improvements to the quality of the implementation with
the addition of more tests and documentation.
There could be additions of support for more loop patterns or tooling
to let the user control which loop patterns are used.
Some of these are more stretch goals if there is time and
others are more immediate concerns.
