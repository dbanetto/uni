==============================

### Question 1

The modified Caesar cipher from Lab 1 did not make it harder to crack using
frequency analysis. Due to the algorithm is just just mapping a clear character
to a cipher character, the frequency of the cipher characters can still be used to
infer the clear character with frequency analysis.

### Question 2

The changes that would be needed is to enter the expected keyword length.
Then after that the crack would treat the vignere cipher as a poly-alphabetic
cipher. Other optimization could be apply to the algorithm.


### Question 3

No, even with the use of Homophones the English language would follow some
rules and correlations such as common 'sh','th' and 'ion' that gives hints to the plain text.

### Question 4

THECH AIRMA NOFTH EFEDE RALRE SERVE BOARD SAIDY ESTER DAYTH ATATA XINCR EASEI SNEED EDNOW


### Question 5

So that cryptanalysts could not determine the words length from the cipher text
