For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?

* Do you think that having both classes "Images" and "ImageNode" is overkill? 
  What pros and cons can you think of in comparison to just using ImageNode?

* Did you notice the different complexity of adding an image
  before vs after the cursor? 
  What are the complexities and what is the cause of this complexity difference? 

* Can you think of an extension to "ImageNode" that would avoid the 
  above mentioned complexity difference? 

* Cursors are a good way of obtaining quick access to a certain point in a list. 
  Can you think of a potential problem if a client does not use Images.setCursor correctly?
