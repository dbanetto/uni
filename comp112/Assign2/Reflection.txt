Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1.  What is the advantage of making a DodgemCar class?  Why is it better
than putting all the code in a single DodgemGame class, like we did
with the floorCleaner in Assignment 1?

The advantage of making a DodgemCar class was being able to make n amount of cars while not having to write each Car in, like the floorCleaner. The use of the DodgemCar class shows the advantages of object oriented
programming to functional.

2. The assignment split the development of both programs into three
stages (Core, Completion, and Challenge).  This was partly for
marking, but it was also intended to make it easier to do the
program.  Why does it it help to have several stages? What Software Engineering
methodology does this reflect?

Breaking down the problem into core, completion and challenge stages help make the projects more manageable as there is tangible goals for each part and a sense of progress. This reflects the divide and conquer methodology.  

3. Last week you constructed a list of the key Java programming
constructs that you used.  Add the important new constructs you used
this week to that list, with a very brief note about each one.

Java.awt.Point – Point class that deals in doubles and calculates distances
Java.awt.Rectangle – Rectangle class that handles interceptions of rectangles.

4. If you learned any more important concepts about programming or Computer
Science, add them to your list from last week.

UI Thread and Main thread. This caused some problems as: if the game is run on the press on a button instead of waiting on the main thread to be activated the UI does not render.
