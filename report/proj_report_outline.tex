\begin{abstract}
Whiley is a programming language that can be used for formal software
verification \cite{whiley-origin}.
One aspect of formal software verification is providing loop
invariants.
Some loop invariants are common for verified software and become a burden to
provide the same loop invariant repetitively \cite{whiley-reflection}\cite{spec-usability}.
The primary goal of this project is to relieve some proof obligations from a
Whiley programmer by automatically providing some simple loop invariants.
Instead the loop invariants are generated by the Whiley Compiler itself.
This project does not attempt to generate loop invariants generally, as it is
known to be uncomputable, but generates invariants for specific common cases.
