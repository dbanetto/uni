\chapter{Evaluation}\label{C:eval}
% The purpose of the evaluation section is to demonstrate whether you did
% or did not satisfy the project goals or specifications.
% If you can tie the performance of your design to some real specification then
% your evaluation is much stronger. “My code runs in 29 ms” is much weaker than
% “my code runs within the 30 ms window allowable for real-time performance of the. . . ”.
%
% In many cases the evaluation of a project requires significant extra work to design and build test harnesses.
% These should be explained so that the validity and scope of the evaluation can be understood.
% Make liberal use of graphs and other figures.
% They are much more effective at communicating many results than are words.

\section{Goal}

\section{Evaluation tool}\label{S:eval-tool}
% explanation of the evaluation tool and what each piece does

\subsection{Breakdown}
% What this does and how it benefits the evaluation
% * normalises the data set
% * removes the difference between the one-liner master and the laid out
% thinker
% * breaks up conjunctive expressions in the loop invariants

\subsection{Minimizing}
% What this does and how it benefits the evaluation
%  * finds the smallest subset of loop invariants for the code to compile
%  * tests with and without 
%  * tests combonations of 

\subsection{Reporting}
% What this does and how it benefits the evaluation
%   include the eval script here to piece it all together
%  * collects data about each run
%  * explain how each data set is tested
%   + files that do not contain while loops are removed via grep'ing them
%   + are checked if they will compile and verify before any changes (removes original errors from data set)
%   + 


\section{Data Sets}
% Explain that there is not much data to pick from
% Discuss the data sets used and what problems they have
