For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (ie. anything in the first 4 lectures, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

In the first two weeks of lectures the topic of implementation and design of the
standard set of collections like lists and sets. The most stand-out part
of the standard collections are how they all map out to how what they are named after
in natural language. For example : Queues can only be added to the back and taken from the
front just like the classic British queue. The only exception to this is the map collection,
where upon further research I found out it is like a linked array between the key, which is hashed
using the base object function hashCode(). Having the dependency on the hashCode function also 
helps to explain why maps or other generic lists cannot have the basic types (boolean, int and char)
