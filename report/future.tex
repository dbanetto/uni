\chapter{Future Work}\label{C:future}
% Future work should not just be a list of things that you
% would have done if you had a little more time.
% Talk about new things that are possible now that you have finished your project.
% What projects could a â€™489 student tackle next year if they started from your end point?

\section{Detection of Duplicate Loop Invariant}
% this could be in the form of lexical, AST, logical equivalence

\section{Expanding Loop Invariant Generators}
% There is more loop patterns that could be used to generate loop invariants
% Not all possible cases are covered by the current implementations
% either find these new invariants by hand, or ML

\section{Visitor Pattern for the Whiley Compiler}
% Current implementations of Generators have cloned structures
% Code duplication could be reduced by using Visitor Pattern
%  * decreases maintenance cost
%  * makes adding new syntax / AST nodes easier
% * technical debt having so many duplicate AST descents

\section{Ghost Variables in Whiley}
% See Ada's `'Old`  syntax
% Declaration of `ghost` prefix to variable declaration so they are only usable
% in program verification

\section{Whiley Pattern Language}
% Regular Expressions for Whiley
% kind of a meta-language to search AST for patterns

\section{Generated Loop Invariants in WhileyWeb}
% Update WhileyWeb to include generated loop invariants
%  * show in the same manner as counter-examples
%  * is the tool most likely used in future course work of the course
% * a pleasant UX in a web IDE
