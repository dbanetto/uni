\section{What is NoSQL}
% brief overview
% compare with relational model

% give definition of a database? (managed store of data)
% relational is based on set theory and relational algebra

\subsection{BASE}
% What it is
% How does it compare to ACID
% What does this mean

\section{Document Store}
% How does it work
%  - key to a structured document
%  - document can be inspected by DBMS
% Relate it back to BASE


\subsection{Use case}
% When are people using this
%  - JSON store
%  - XML store
% Example of use case
%  - Searching

\subsection{When to use it}
% Why are people choosing this
% Compare to relational counterpart

\section{Column base}
% How does it work
% Relate it back to BASE

\subsection{Use case}
% When are people using this
% Example of use case

\subsection{When to use it}

\section{Key-value store}
% How does it work
