\chapter{Conclusions}\label{C:con}

\comment{
 Goal of chapter: 

  * reflect on the project, \\
  * how it was accomplished, \\
  * what it accomplished, \\
  * what could be done better next time, \\
  * what was learnt. \\
}

\section{Accomplishments}
\comment{talk about how the goal of the project was accomplished, loop invariants are generated for Whiley}

\section{Reflection}
\comment{How well did things go? Room for improvement? Is this appropriate?}

\section{Related Work}
\comment{Covers the literature review and compare current solution to similar projects}

\fixme{Should this be in the conclusion section rather than here?}

\subsection{Dafny}
\comment{
explain how dafny is an alternative to Whiley in the Spec Lang space
has some features that are missing in Whiley that would be interesting to use

* declaring variables as increasing or decreasing \\
* defining variables / fields as ghosts, to only be used in specifications
dafny - other formal language
}

An alternative to the Whiley language is the Dafny.
Dafny is a research language for a verifying compiler by Microsoft
\cite{dafny-lang}.
The language shares a majority of the same features as
