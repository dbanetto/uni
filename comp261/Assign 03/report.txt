What the Program does do
------------------------

* Loads the model / scene from file
* Renders the scene
* Can rotate, translate, and scale the scene
  Controls : Rotate WASD
			 Scale Q E
			 Translation Arrow keys
* Can, on button press, center on the scene
* Added dynamic lights
  Control: L

What the Program does not do
----------------------------

* implement Gouraud shading or Phong shading


What bugs have not been resolved
--------------------------------

* Rendered polygons may sometimes have long extending lines out,
  this is most likely due to float errors or infinity gradients.
  However most of the bug has been contained with only allowing
  drawing within the polygon's bounds on the screen and float error
  checks (NaN and infinity)


How the Program was tested
--------------------------

* Mainly through comparing the rendered results with the given
  images

* Stepping through problem areas with debugger

* With transformations, some simple sanity checks were done by hand

Extensions
----------

* re-positions model to 0,0,z
