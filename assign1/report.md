<!--
This assignment addresses course learning objectives:

    Communicate at a professional level orally and in writing, to a varied range of audiences.
    Function effectively in a team in a variety of roles. 

using the recruitment exercise for the ENGR 301 projects as the subject.
In the recruitment exercise you have been asked to form selection panels and consider aspects of communication between applicants and panel.
The first assignment is to write a short report on your personal experiences in the recruitment exercise, focussing on communication and functioning in a team.
Aspects of communication and team roles you should give thought to are:

 *  verbal communication, both written and oral, and both applicant and panel.
 *  nonverbal communication, both applicant and panel.
 *  conflict resolution within the panel.
 *  the asymmetry between applicants and panel (e.g. in numbers, knowledge, power, communication, etc.) 

Selection panels are encouraged to communicate with their project's clients for more information.
Such communication is a legitimate subject for examination in the report.
As final applicant rankings for project places are due 12 pm on Tuesday 14 March, there is still some time to consider contacting project clients.
Contact the Course Coordinator if you wish to be introduced to a project client.

Some suggested questions which might be reflected upon in the assignment are:

 *  What was it like to be on the other side of the table?
 *  What where the good things and the bad things you saw in the Project Applications you read?
 *  What were the good things and bad things you observed during the interviews?
 *  Were there any insights or realisations which you recall in particular?
 *  How were panel discussions conducted, particularly when there were disagreements?
 *  How did the panel communicate with the applicants
 *  What was it that, in hindsight, the panel communicated? 

notes:
 * hard to hold impressions of interviewees with the fast pace between interviews

    - used downtime to look for them

    - had to sit out of two interviews, only had 3 of us on the panel and put more
