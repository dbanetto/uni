<h1>Felids</h1>

<p>Felidae is the name of the biological family of cats; a member of
this family is called a felid, or cat. The most familiar felid is the
domestic cat, which first became associated with humans about 10,000
years ago, but the family includes all other wild cats, including the
big cats.</p>

<p>Extant felids belong to one of two subfamilies: Pantherinae (which
includes the tiger, the lion, the jaguar, the leopard, and the snow
leopard), and Felinae (which includes the cougar, the cheetah, the
lynxes, the ocelot, the leopard cat, and the domestic cat).</p>

<p>The first felids emerged during the Oligocene, about 25 million
years ago. In prehistoric times, a third subfamily, the
Machairodontinae, included the "saber-toothed cats", such as the
well-known Smilodon. Other superficially cat-like mammals, such as the
metatherians Thylacosmilus and Thylacoleo, or the Nimravidae, are not
included in Felidae despite superficial similarities.</p>

<p>Felids are the strictest carnivores of the 13 terrestrial families
in the order Carnivora, although the three families of marine mammals
comprising the superfamily Pinnipedia are as carnivorous as the
felids. Felids are obligate carnivores - they must consume meat to
survive - and are sometimes referred to as hypercarnivores because of
the much higher proportion of protein they require in their diet, much
more than most other mammals.[3]</p>
