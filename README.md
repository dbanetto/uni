# University mono repo

This repository contains all of my (git tracked) work over university, 2014-2017.

There are missing content/assignments/labs since not all courses could be
tracked with git. Other missing content is likely from group projects that are
in team repositories or controlled by the University itself.

## **WARNING FOR CURRENT STUDENTS**

**If you are here to find answers or to steal content, it will not help you
pass**

**If you are having trouble, the lectures, tutors and your classmates are willing
and able to help you. This is not a competition, everyone is at Uni to learn.
I can guarantee they will be more helpful than this repo. If all else fails
you can email on the address listed on this account**

## Creating mono repo

This mono repo was created by using the included `merge.sh` script to bring in
unrelated git histories to preserve all history from these courses.
