This is a proposal for a case study into the failure of the 2nd Mt. Victoria tunnel in Wellington.

Topic must address two points:

 * Assess the *social*, cultural, *legal*, health & safety, environmental and
   sustainability implications of their engineering work, and identify
   and justify specific actions to address issues;

So, please focus on one of
    * communication
	* ethics
	* << legal compliance >>
	* entrepreneurship
	* finance
	* culture/society.

Topic: the failure of the Basin Flyover

# Abstract

This is a proposal for a case study into the failure of the Basin Flyover
project in 2014.

The Basin Flyover project is a sub-project to improve the major roads
in Wellington and is related to the improvements the Mt. Victoria Tunnel.
It was canceled due to failing to get the go ahead from the Environmental
Protection Agency on ground that the total costs of the project did not
outweigh the benefits of the project.

This case study will focus on how the communication,
heritage and amenity impacts of the project where handled.
It will draw recommendations to help improve
the success of similar projects and better understanding its failings.

# Background
<!-- listing of resources & descriptions of refs -->

The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) has a long term project to improve the
state highway 1 (SH1) from Wellington Airport to Levin called the
Wellington Northern Corridor (WNC) [@northern_corridor].
As a part of this project there are multiple sub-projects to improve sections of
the Wellington region's SH1 roads and in total is budgeted for \$2.5 billion [@treasury_exp_2016].
One of these projects is to improve Airport to Mt. Victoria project which included
expanding or constructing a second tunnel through Mt. Victoria to increases the
lanes from two to four[@northern_corridor].
A consequence of this is that they will need to also upgrade
the roads leadings to and from the tunnel(s) via Kilbirnie and the Basin
Reserve [@mt_vic_tunnel_2017].

The NZTA initially put forward 6 options to improve the Basin Reserve's
access to Mt. Victoria Tunnel [@basin_options_report] in 2011. From these options
that included flyover, tunnels and changing the road layout around the Basin
Reserve [@basin_options_report].
Each option was compared on how well they met the four objectives of the
project:

 * To provide greater resilience, efficiency and reliability to SH1
 * To support regional economic growth & productivity
 * To support mobility and modal choices within Wellington City
 * To improve the efficiency of the road transport network by separating SH1
   from inner-city travel

There is also the implicit objective of the total benefits of the project to outweigh the
costs.
With these objectives in mind the option for a flyover won since it best met
the objectives of NZTA and stakeholders [@basin_options_summary] in 2012.

The Basin flyover plan was developed and put to the Environment Protection Agency
(EPA) for resource consent.
Their verdict was that the plan was not satisfactory
 to allow the project to go forward [@epa_report] in 2014.
The EPA say that the plan for the Flyover did not handle the impacts of the
project on heritage and the amenity of the Basin Reserve area.

In EPA's report they provided a balanced view by included an alternate view to 
their own into the final report [@epa_report].
The alternate view by David McMahon who has the role of challenging the EPA findings.
David reported that the EPA overstated the importance of the heritage
and amenity impacts. He argued that this over importance tipped the scales
so that the project failed.
He concluded that the Basin Flyover project should be given the green
light because the benefits out weighed the costs.

The EPA's final decision was to deny the Basin Flyover.
This ruling was testing in the High Court and was upheld.
Thus the Basin Flyover project concluded as a failure since
it achieve none of its objectives.

# Problem

When engineering projects have catastrophic failures a case study into
the failure are common [@presidential1986report]. The Basin Flyover project failed during the
planning phase without harming anyone but the tax payer's pockets [@rnz_flyover_cost].
However, a investigation into this failure is still warranted to learn
from the process.

The final EPA report identified a range of issues with the project.
It was found that the plan for the Basin Flyover plan did not achieve a
net benefit in terms of visual landscape, the projected transport benefit, handling of
heritage sites and more.

Local residents had submitted their concerns about the impacts of the
project. The environmental, mainly increased air pollution, and noise complaints
were shown to be be mitigated by experts [@epa_report].
However, they did agree on the concern of the noise but only during construction.

The EPA also question the method of how the final options for the project
was chosen. They commented on the how flyover-based options were given some
easier requirements to meet when comparing the cost to tunnel-based options
but they did not give the same comparison against changing the road
layout [@epa_report].

A failed project of this scale always has consequences.
The result of the Basin Flyover failing is that
the parent project, Wellington Northern Corridor, is delayed.
These delays are compounded by NZTA moving staff from these projects
in Wellington to other regions [@treasury_exp_2016].

# Proposed Investigation

The proposed investigation will follow a case study format.
This format will be informed by University of New South Wales (UNSW)
advise to its Engineering faculty [@unsw_case_study].
The focus of the case study will be focusing on the failure of the
Basin Flyover plan and if the engineering responsibility to ensure
legal compliance was managed properly.

The primary sources of information is the final report that details the
decision made by the EPA [@epa_report], official releases
from NZTA about the Basin Flyover [@basin_options_summary] [@basin_options_report].
Other sources will be used to corroborate the findings from EPA.

The case study will focus on where NZTA excelled, and not.
These aspects will be viewed primarily from the perspective of
the legal responsibilities of NZTA and their impacts.
A key area where NZTA excelled is the community engagement of the
project and clear communications to the public and stakeholders.
This is made very clear with the amount of information they
released with: the options outlines ; option selection ; and, videos
of simulations of the final product.
EPA comments on that they cannot reproduce the same selection
of the options presented.
Their report also shows that NZTA attempted to manage the impacts of
the development but was not enough.
The impact not handled well enough was the detrimental impact on the heritage of
the area, Basin Reserve and Government House.

With the findings from the above aspects a recommendation will be formed.
This recommendation has the goal of improving the likelihood for similar
projects to succeed.
