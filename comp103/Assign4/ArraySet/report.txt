	Completion : 13/13 passed

Benchmarking:
What were the results of your timing tests?
(Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for both

Tests done on a AMD FX-4100 with 8GiB of RAM and on a hard drive

Time to load:
	HashSet     ~150ms
	ArraySet ~297060ms

Time to Check:
	Plato:
		HashSet  :    ~660ms
		ArraySet : ~189000ms

	Hamlet:
		HashSet  :   ~660ms
