# Discussion
<!--
 - this was due to multiple failures to meet the requirements of the RMA
    - subset of these failtuers are: alteratives & hertiage site

    - alternatives 
        - "methodology,  particularly  the  need  for transparency and replicability, is important" [1273]
        - "it was not clear how criteria were weighted and the reason for any weighting.
           This made the process somewhat confusing and difficult to follow.  
           It also meant that the process could not be replicated" [1274]
        - section: 171(1) Whether adequate consideration has been given to alternative sites, routes & methods

        - highlights the requirement of transprancy when using finite resources like Land, city space, culture, anemity

    - hertiage sites
        - section 6(f) recongise & provide for protection of historic heritage from inappropriate development
        - public outcry tipped the balance & defended the Basin
        - King Salmon, case applied to '*inappropriate* development' 
        - test-cricket status of the Basin Reserve venue [1259]

        - highlights the importance of history and the community support for the site
