Testing: SortedArraySet

Which test methods succeeded or failed on your implementation of SortedArraySet:
	All Succeeded

Performance Benchmarking:
What were the results of your timing tests?
(Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for
  - SortedArraySet, ArraySet, and HashSet.
  - dictionaryUnsorted.txt and dictionarySorted.txt

Data Used| Test | Sorted Array Set | ArraySet | HashSet
Unsorted |Load  |        293.86s   | 279.70s  | 0.259s
         |Check |          1.71s   | 174.62s  | 0.192s
-------------------------------------------------------
Sorted   |Load  |          0.60s   | 279.83s  | 0.265s
         |Check |          2.83s   | 173.70s  | 0.279s

The results from the bench-marking is not surprising as it
is expected that the HashSet is extremely fast with its O(1)
search for an existing element against the O(n) of the ArraySet
and O(log(n)) of SortedArraySet.

What was a surprise was the speed up in the load time from unsorted
data to sorted data for the SortedArraySet. Taking it from ArraySet
levels to nearly challenge the HashSet
