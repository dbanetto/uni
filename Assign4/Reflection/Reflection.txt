For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Java provides several different implementations of the =Set= type, including =HashSet= and
=TreeSet=.  Why didn't it provide =ArraySet= ?  (After all, it provided the
=ArrayList= implementation of the =List= type!).


Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
testing. Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.

Got up to Challenge in ArraySet
Got up to Challenge in ArrayQueue

The main problem was trying to get reflection to work so I could test
the value of data in ArrayQueue, but then opted for public access to the 
base array for simplicity.

Java does not provide an ArraySet because it is horrendously slow compared
to the other two implementations. This is generally caused by most operations
(add, remove, find) in ArraySet are O(n) operations with HashSet being O(1) as
it uses hashes. This is even more shown by the benchmarking done with HashSet being
up to 198040% better than its ArraySet counterpart.

Some guidelines or principles when writing tests could be :
 one test method should test one feature each. 
 A test class should correspond to one class
 Each test case should be autonomous (non-order dependent)
