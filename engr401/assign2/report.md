This is a proposal for a case study into the failure of the 2nd Mt. Victoria tunnel in Wellington.

Topic must address two points:

 * Assess the *social*, cultural, *legal*, health & safety, environmental and
   sustainability implications of their engineering work, and identify
   and justify specific actions to address issues;

So, please focus on one of
    * communication

# Abstract

This is a proposal for a case study into the failure of the Basin Flyover
project.

The Basin Flyover project was a sub-project that intended to improve
the major roads in Wellington.
It was canceled as it failed to get the go ahead from the Environmental
Protection Agency on grounds that the total costs of the project did not
outweigh the benefits.

This case study will focus on how communication, heritage and amenity impacts of the project were handled.
It will draw recommendations on how to improve of future 
projects of a similar nature as well as provide understanding as why such projects fail.

# Background
<!-- listing of resources & descriptions of refs -->

The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) has a long term project to improve the
state highway 1 (SH1) from Wellington Airport to Levin called the
Wellington Northern Corridor (WNC) [@northern_corridor].
There are multiple sub-projects within this projectg which intend to improve sections of
Wellington region's SH1 roads, the total budget for the entire project is \$2.5 billion [@treasury_exp_2016].

One of these projects was to improve Airport to Mt. Victoria which included
expanding or constructing a second tunnel through Mt. Victoria to improve
the traffic flow [@northern_corridor].
In addition to this is that they will need to also upgrade
the roads leadings to and from the tunnel(s) via Kilbirnie and the Basin
Reserve [@mt_vic_tunnel_2017].

In 2011 NZTA initially put forward six options to improve the Basin Reserve's
access to Mt. Victoria Tunnel [@basin_options_report].
From these options there were three distinct methods to solve the engineering problem.
These were to constructing  a flyover, tunnel or changing the road layout [@basin_options_report] 
so that the traffic coming out of Mt. Victoria Tunnel leads straight to tunnel under the War Memorial Park.
Each of these themes had two variations, keeping the new construction close to the Basin Reserve or positioning
further away.
Each option was compared on how well they met the four objectives of the
project:

 * To provide greater resilience, efficiency and reliability to SH1
 * To support regional economic growth & productivity
 * To support mobility and modal choices within Wellington City
 * To improve the efficiency of the road transport network by separating SH1
   from inner-city travel

There is also the implicit objective of the total benefits of the project to outweigh the
costs.
In 2012 NZTA and stakeholders selected the flyover was the best fit to their objectives
and chose it as the design to move forward with [@basin_options_summary].

The Basin flyover plan was developed and put to the Environment Protection Agency
(EPA) for resource consent.
The EPA did not allow the project to go forward. As they believed NZTA had not
handled the impact the project would have on the heritage and amenity of the
Basin Reserve area to a satisfactory level.

In EPA's report they provide a balanced view by including an alternate view to 
their own [@epa_report].
The alternate view was by provided David McMahon who had the role of challenging the EPA findings.
David reported that the EPA overstated the importance of the heritage
and amenity impacts. He argued that this over importance tipped the scales
so that the project failed.
He concluded that the Basin Flyover project should be given the green
light because the benefits out weighed the costs.

The EPA's final decision was to deny the Basin Flyover.
This ruling was tested in the High Court and was upheld.
With this ruling none of the objectives of the Basin Flyover 
were achieved so the project concluded as a failure.

# Problem

When engineering projects have catastrophic failures a case study into
the failure are common [@presidential1986report]. The Basin Flyover project failed during the
planning phase without harming anyone but the tax payer's pockets [@rnz_flyover_cost].
However, a investigation into this failure is still warranted to learn
from the process.

The final EPA report identified a range of issues with the project.
It was found that the plan for the Basin Flyover plan did not achieve a
net benefit in terms of visual landscape, the projected transport benefit, handling of
heritage sites and more.

Local residents had submitted their concerns about the impacts of the
project [@public_enagement].
Their concerns were in two main aspects, environmental impact and amenity.
First was the environmental and impacts, primarily increased air pollution.
The expert opinion on the matter was that there would be likely no increased
degradation of air quality in the long term compared to not having the Flyover [@epa_report].
However, they did agree that the concern of the noise during construction was
justified.
The second concern of the amenity of the Basin Reserve would severely be
impacted by building a fly over.
The EPA agreed with this sentiment but David McMahon did not.

The EPA also question the method of how the final options for the project
was chosen. They commented on the how flyover-based options were given some
easier requirements to meet when comparing the cost to tunnel-based options
but they did not give the same comparison against changing the road
layout [@epa_report].

A failed project of this scale always has consequences.
The result of the Basin Flyover failing is that
the parent project, Wellington Northern Corridor, was delayed.
These delays were compounded by NZTA moving staff from these projects
in Wellington to other regions [@treasury_exp_2016].

# Proposed Investigation

The proposed investigation will follow a case study format.
This format will be informed by University of New South Wales (UNSW)
advise to its Engineering faculty [@unsw_case_study].
The focus of the case study will be focusing on the failure of the
Basin Flyover plan and if the engineering responsibility to ensure
legal compliance was managed properly.

The primary sources of information is the final report that details the
decision made by the EPA [@epa_report], official releases
from NZTA about the Basin Flyover [@basin_options_summary] [@basin_options_report].
Other sources will be used to corroborate the findings from EPA.

The case study will focus on where NZTA excelled, and not.
These aspects will be viewed primarily from the perspective of
the legal responsibilities of NZTA and their impacts.
A key area where NZTA excelled is the community engagement of the
project and clear communications to the public and stakeholders.
This is made very clear with the amount of information they
released with: the options outlines ; option selection ; and, videos
of simulations of the final product.
EPA comments on that they cannot reproduce the same selection
of the options presented.
Their report also shows that NZTA attempted to manage the impacts of
the development but was not enough.
The impact not handled well enough was the detrimental impact on the heritage of
the area, Basin Reserve and Government House.

With the findings from the above aspects a recommendation will be formed.
This recommendation has the goal of improving the likelihood for similar
projects to succeed.
