For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got on this assignment. If there was a problem you got stuck on what was that problem?

* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.
