\chapter{Implementation}\label{C:impl}
% The aim here is to explain the technical aspects of the project.
% The challenge is to ensure the text is clear and understandable.
% This is not easy, as ideas and concepts involved are often complex in nature.
% Nevertheless, if an examiners cannot understand how the implementation works,
% he/she cannot award marks for it.
% If this happens, the student is fault for poor communication.
%
% Remember:
% nothing is so complicated that it cannot be clearly explained.
% Classic pitfalls include:
%     * long convoluted sentences,
%     * use of long words,
%     * too much time spent discussing irrelevant details,
%     * poor organisation of sections, subsections and paragraphs,
%     * and too few diagrams or examples.
