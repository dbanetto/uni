\chapter{Design}\label{C:design}
% The aim here is to identify the key trade-offs in any design work you have undertaken.
% When solving a complex problem, there are normally many different
% approaches one can take — each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
% It is expected that students will have initially considered a range of different solutions,
% and will then have narrowed these down. The reasons why a particular approach was
% discounted should be documented here.
%
% Remember:
% Appropriate design notation (e.g. UML diagrams) can be very helpful in conveying different aspects of a design.
% It is vital that your design not be carried out in a vacuum.
% Your design should be motivated very clearly by your goals and specifications.
% Make sure that it is clear why you took the decisions that you did.
% Do not give the impression that you settled on a design because it “felt right”
% or that you tinkered around until you found something that worked.
