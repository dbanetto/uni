<!--
This is a proposal for a case study into the failure of the 2nd Mt. Victoria tunnel in Wellington.

Topic must address two points:

 * Assess the *social*, cultural, *legal*, health & safety, environmental and
   sustainability implications of their engineering work, and identify
   and justify specific actions to address issues;

So, please focus on one of
    * communication
	* ethics
	* << legal compliance >>
	* entrepreneurship
	* finance
	* culture/society.

Topic: the failure of the Basin Flyover

# Abstract


# Background
<!-- listing of resources & descriptions of refs -->

The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) has a long term project to improve the
state highway 1 (SH1) from Wellington Airport to Levin called the
Wellington Northern Corridor (WNC) [@northern_corridor].
As apart of this project there are multiple sub-projects to improve sections of
the Wellington region's SH1 roads and in total is budgeted for \$2.5 billion [@treasury_exp_2016].
One of these projects is to improve Airport to Mt. Victoria project which included
expanding or constructing a second tunnel through Mt. Victoria to increases the
lanes from two to four[@northern_corridor].
A consequence of this is that they will need to also upgrade
the roads leadings to and from the tunnel(s) via Kilbirnie and the Basin
Reserve [@mt_vic_tunnel_2017].

The NZTA initially put forward 6 options to improve the Basin Reserve's
access to Mt. Victoria Tunnel [@basin_options_report]. From these options
that included flyover, tunnels and changing the road layout around the Basin
Reserve [@basin_options_report].
Each option was compared on how well they met the four objectives of the
project:

 * To provide greater resilience, efficiency and reliability to SH1
 * To support regional economic growth & productivity
 * To support mobility and modal choices within Wellington City
 * To improve the efficiency of the road transport network by separating SH1
   from inner-city travel

There is also the hidden objective of the total benefits of the project to outweigh the
costs.
With these objectives in mind the option for a flyover won since it best met
the objectives of NZTA and stakeholders [@basin_options_summary].

The Basin flyover plan was developed and put to the Environment Protection Agency
(EPA) for resource consent.
Their verdict was that the plan did not meet the
requirements to allow the project to be implemented [@epa_report].

After the EPA declined the Basin Flyover plan the decision was taken to the
High court. The appeal was unsuccessful and thus the Basin Flyover project
concluded as a failure since it achieve none of its objectives.

# Problem

When engineering projects have catastrophic failures a case study into
the failure are common [@presidential1986report]. The Basin Flyover project failed during the
planning phase without harming anyone but the tax payer's pockets [@rnz_flyover_cost].
However, a investigation into this failure is still warranted to learn
from the process.

The preliminary research into the Basin Flyover shows that the main stumbling
block was legal compliance.
It was found that the plan for the Basin Flyover did not meet the requirements
of environmental concerns, the projected transport benefit, handling of
heritage sites and more.
The EPA also question the method of how the final options for the project
was chosen, commenting on the how flyover-based options were given some
preferential treatment in how they compared the cost to tunnel-based options
but did not give the same weighting when compared against changing the road
layout [@epa_report].

A failed project of this scale always has consequences.
The result of the Basin Flyover failing is that
the parent project, Wellington Northern Corridor, is delayed.
These delays are compounded by NZTA moving staff from these projects
in Wellington to other regions [@treasury_exp_2016].

# Proposed Investigation

The proposed investigation will follow a case study format.
This format will be informed by University of New South Wales (UNSW)
advise to its Engineering faculty [@unsw_case_study].
The focus of the case study will be focusing on the failure of the
Basin Flyover plan and if the engineering responsibility to ensure
legal compliance was managed properly.

Information used in this investigation

The primary sources of information is the final report that details the
decision made by the EPA [@epa_report], official releases
from NZTA about the Basin Flyover [@basin_options_summary] [@basin_options_report].

The goal of the case study is to provide a recommendation of how to avoid the
issues that arose during the planning of the Basin Flyover.
