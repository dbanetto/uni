For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Java provides several different implementations of the =Set= type, including =HashSet= and
=TreeSet=.  Why didn't it provide =ArraySet= ?  (After all, it provided the
=ArrayList= implementation of the =List= type!).


Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.
