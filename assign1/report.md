<!--
using the recruitment exercise for the ENGR 301 projects as the subject.
In the recruitment exercise you have been asked to form selection panels and consider
aspects of communication between applicants and panel.
The first assignment is to write a short report on your personal experiences in the recruitment exercise,
focussing on communication and functioning in a team.
Aspects of communication and team roles you should give thought to are:

 *  verbal communication, both written and oral, and both applicant and panel.
 *  nonverbal communication, both applicant and panel.
 *  conflict resolution within the panel.
 *  the asymmetry between applicants and panel (e.g. in numbers, knowledge, power, communication, etc.) 

Selection panels are encouraged to communicate with their project's clients for more information.
Such communication is a legitimate subject for examination in the report.

Some suggested questions which might be reflected upon in the assignment are:

 *  What was it like to be on the other side of the table?
    - hetic
    - not nervous since this time it did not decide what I was goning to do for a year just what I will be dicussing for the next week.
 *  What were the good things and bad things you observed during the interviews?
     - Good: even though some of the candidates did not pick our project they still did some research before the interview
     - Bad: One interviewee was very disinterested in our project, ended with "Please do not give me the job".
 *  Were there any insights or realisations which you recall in particular?
 *  How were panel discussions conducted, particularly when there were disagreements?
    - the initial rankings before the interviews were by Peter and I since at that point we were a panel of 2
    - Reuben and I handled the rankings post-interviews since Peter was late.
 *  How did the panel communicate with the applicants
    - verbal:
        - allow them to introduce themselves
        - give a brief overview of the project
        - ask questions about previous team experiences & how they went
        - ask about if they have used any of the tools listed & if they wanted to learn them
    - non-verbal
        - the panel was all engaged with what the candiate was saying
        - to our downfall we only took some very brief notes after the interview, such as "Euphemistic" or "Not keen" to give us some prompt to remember the canidate later
            ( that did not work out too well for me)
 *  What was it that, in hindsight, the panel communicated? 
    - we had a desire for a candidate that is up for learning new tools and skills
    - we did not communicate the importanace of critical thinking to the project for compare & contrasting different solutions
    - that it was OK to not know anything about the tools being used just a willing to learn them & explain them to your team.

notes:
 * hard to hold impressions of interviewees with the fast pace between interviews
 * had 3 no-shows
    - used downtime to look for them
    - discuss how we are going
 * had 2 conflicts of interest
    - afterwards Peter was discussing what would of happened if I did not abstane from 
    - had to sit out of two interviews, only had 3 of us on the panel and put more
    - how well did I handle it? Johnathan was surprise
        - moved myself physically away from the table
 * insights
    - charisma makes a large difference in how you view someone
    -  
 * could of been clearer about brief description about project we needed to give

This report will describe the recruitment for Project 6, ADRI, and my
experience through the recruitment process.
Focusing on the communication between applicants and the panel and how the
panel team functioned.
<!-- ADD THINGS THAT WILL BE COVERED -->

The panel team for project 6, ADRI Online repository of Arabic digital content,
with Peter Scriven and Reuben Puketapu.
The outline for the project describes its purpose in two stages.
The first stage is to investigate a range of open source repository tools and
create a report about the suitability of them.
The second stage is to create tools to deploy the chosen repository with
a range of different tools. From this outline our panel decided the attributes we
were looking for in an ideal candidates is the willingness to learn a range of new
tools and a bonus would be if they were confident with being able to
teach what they have learnt to other team members.

The panel used the CVs given to us to try to identify candidates that show 
these attributes. Since the project 6 was not a popular choice we had only 1 CV with a
direct application to our project.
Form this we needed to read their applications to other projects
to give everyone a fair chance and to attempt to gauge their suitability for the project.
From reading all of the applications there was some common aspects that made a good
CV and conversely some that hurt the CV.
A common aspect of a good CV that I saw was a well written application that also 
included some insight about the character of the applicant generally expressed in a
story of how they obtained some experience such as participating in hackathons or their own side-projects.
I found this style of expressing their skills and interests to be effective to
establish their character and skills with strong credibility and is something I will
take to writing my next CV due to positive impact it had on my impression from the applicant.
CVs that lacked this aspect were harder to judge as they become difficult to
understand how the skills they describe are backed by any passion for the subject 
or how they would be in an environment with pressure to learn new tools.
<!-- 
    talk about good & bad points of CVs (written communication)
 *  What where the good things and the bad things you saw in the Project Applications you read?
    -   having only one canidate that placed our project in top 3 we read all the applications for other projects on their CVs
    -   Good: gems that would give some insight of what the person is like, such as showing some passion for external acticities or quick stories.
    -   Bad: very loose reasoning about why they wanted to be in a project, such as 'I played a card game once'

These interviews were my first time interviewing a candidate for a position.
From being an interviewer I noticed more about with how interviewees and interviewers
interact then I had being on the other side of the table.
A majority of our interviewees did not select our project so our panel decided
to brief description of the project, which included our expectations of a member of the
project.
One of the most important details I found was the panel comes to the interview
with a set of attributes that they want to confirm that the interviewee has given
that their CV outlined them.
This puts the interviewee at a disadvantage with trying to meet these hidden attributes
and shows the power advantage the interviewers has.
Our panel tried to mitigate this in the brief of the project we gave to our interviewees.
In hindsight this mitigation might not of been fair as we hoped for as we dumping
these expectations onto them during the interview with no time to prepare for them,
although the ability to react could be an attribute we are looking for.
From past experience of nerves with interviews lead to our panel to start the
interview with handshakes.
This had the aim to set a friendly atmosphere instead of that of judging.
We attempted to carry this atmosphere by making the interview more of a
conversation about the project and the interviewee's experiences then
drilling them with questions. 
A side-effect of this is we did not take notes during the interviews but
took holist notes at the end of the interview.
These notes reflected the entire interview more then answers to individual questions.
The main consequence of this was it became a lot harder to retrace our
decision process of how we came to the suitability of the candidate since we lost
our intermediate.


During the interviews I had two interviewees that were conflicts of interest.
