Changes to the echo server / client.

The echo server's joke was changed to:

Knock, Knock
Justin
Justin Who?
Just in the neighbourhood, thought I would drop by.

To achieve these changes I changed the sequence of messsage and
the  replies printed in EchoClient.java and also updated the
message checks and replies in Connection.java.

Evidence of the program function

> EchoServer

Waiting for connections on 43501
Client 1: Knock, knock
Server: Who's there?
Client 1: Justin
Server: Justin who?
Client 1: Just in the neighborhood, thought I would drop by.
Server: <<<<groan>>>>
Client 1: bye

> EchoClient

Who's there?
Justin who?
<<<<groan>>>>

==========================================

Changes to the Search.

To achieve a user defined amount of keys to try the number is captured from the
arguments of the program.

The argument list was changed from:

    Search <starting key> <key size> <ciphertext>

To:

    Search <starting key> <key size> <number to try> <ciphertext>

Using the the <number to try> instead of the contast 100 in the loop of different
keys to try.

Evidence of Program's fucntion:
note: non-printable characters have been omitted with a `...`

The command below gave the following output.

> Search 3185209670 4 1 :+UHC88LxQEgKq6BmdGo31UtE5HqTimlZssAZMXqSXXXT7NJLc52Fng==

The command below gave the following output.
