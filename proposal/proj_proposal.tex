\begin{abstract}
    % This document gives some ideas about how to write a project
    % proposal, and provides a template for a proposal. You should discuss
    % your proposal with your supervisor.
    An obstacle to using Whiley for formally verified software is the 
    repetition of simple loop invariants.
    This project is to generate simple loop invariants using
    known techniques, such as static analysis and post-condition mutation.
    The project will research these methods and implement some techniques
    into the Whiley language.
    The success of this project is evaluated based off the reduction
    of simple loop invariants for the general Whiley programmer.

% Whiley is a programming language designed to support formal verification, and now using in teacher SWEN224 at VUW.
% One of the biggest obstacles to practical use of Whiley,
% especially in a teaching context, is the need for  the programmer to provide detailed loop invariants,
% many of which are stating trivial or obvious properties.
% The aim of this project is to develop techniques to generate simple loop invariants for Whiley,
% so as to ease the burden on the programmer,
% allowing them to focus on more interesting invariants that relate directly to the properties the are trying to establish.
%
% It is well that generating loop invariants is very hard - indeed, it is uncomputable in general.
% The emphasis in this project is not on generality but on practicality.
% The first step will be to look at some of the approaches that have been described in the literature,
% and then implement one of them, or some combination, in Whiley, then look at ways in which this can be improved.
% Ideally, then implementation will be available in time to be evaluated with SWEN224 students in Trimester 2.

\section*{1. Introduction}

%%% Given text
%% In this section you should include a very brief introduction to the
%% problem to the problem and the project.
%
%% Your project proposal should cover the following points:
%
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item the engineering problem that you are going to solve;
%%     \item how you plan to solve your problem;
%%     \item how you intend to evaluate your solution; and
%%     \item any resource requirements for your project such as software,
%%         hardware or other resources that will be needed in the course of the
%%         project.
%% \end{itemize}

Formal verification is an important tool to ensure the correctness of software.
This generally requires the programmer to specify invariants such as
pre- and post-conditions for procedures or invariants for a type and many more.
One type of invariant is the loop invariant,
which must hold upon entering the loop, each iteration of the loop 
and on termination of the loop \cite{invarints-classifiction}.
To specify these invariants correctly it takes expert knowledge and is an obstacle
to adoption of formal verification.

Whiley is a programming language for formal verification which loop invariants 
is an obstacle for the programmer. This project aims to reduce this 
burden by generating simple loop invariants for the programmer through different
techniques.

These techniques could include static analysis of the program, mutating specification
given or any other technique described in the literature. Thus the project
will start with a survey of existing literature and learning the Whiley language
and compiler. This leads to implementing techniques that are identified to be a
benefit to Whiley.

The resources needed to complete this project are generally provided by the University.
However it would be a great addition to be able to communicate with the lead developer
of Whiley, David J. Pearce.

% Your proposal should be not more than than 4 pages long with about 3 pages of content.

\section*{2. The Problem}

%%% WHAT

% problem: Whiley requires detailed loop invariants to be provided
% some of these are tedious and can be to make, index within bound of array, &
% the reader can see these from inspection (trivial and tedious).

%\cite{infer-dynamic}
%\cite{infer-postconditions}
%\cite{invarints-classifiction}
%\cite{whiley-design}

The programming language Whiley is designed for software verification \cite{whiley-design} and
faces the issue of simple loop invariants are a burden to implement.
This project aims to lift some of the burden from the programmer to specify loop invariants
by generating simple loop invariants from the provided code and specification.
This project will not generate loop invariants in general as it is known to be incomputable
in general but a sub-set of loop invariants are possible and has been generated \cite{infer-dynamic} \cite{infer-postconditions}.
These use methods such as dynamically testing the code for invariants, mutating the post condition of the loop
and using static analysis to determine invariants \cite{infer-dynamic} \cite{infer-postconditions}.

Figure \ref{fig:whiley-ex-1} shows an example snippet of Whiley shows a simple invariant.
The invariant ensures that the index \code{i} keeps within the bounds of \code{items}.
This can be verified by sight from the termination condition of the loop and how \code{i} is modified.
The aim of the project is to reduce the need to invariants such as this by implementing
a loop invariant generator for the Whiley language so that the programmer will not have
to specify simple invariants like this so they could focus on more interesting invariants.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
    function indexOf(int[] items, int item) -> (int r)
        ensures r == |items| || items[r] == item:

        int i = 0

        while i < |items|
        where i >= 0 && i <= |items|:

            if items[i] == item:
                break
            i = i + 1

        return i
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Example of current Whiley code.}
    \label{fig:whiley-ex-1}
\end{figure}

% Why is this important:
% * Whiley is used in SWEN224 to teach the younglings about verified code & software correctness
% * Obstacle to practical use of Whiley, in a teaching context and industry


% Aim:
% * Make it easier to program by reducing the amount of tedious/trivial proofs (demonstrate less code)
% * generate loop invariants based off code using methods described in literature. (implement algorithms from literature)
% * to make it modular and be able to turn off generation to let
%   students think about these easy loop invariants (implement modularity)


%%% Given text
%% In this section you should give a brief description of the problem
%% itself. You want to briefly explain the problem, why it is important
%% to solve the problem and define your project aims. After reading this
%% section, the reader should understand why it is a problem, believe
%% that it is important to solve and have a clear idea of the aims of
%% your project.
%
%% When describing the aims of the project, you should avoid vague,
%% unmeasurable words like `analyse', `investigate', `describe', and use
%% specific, measurable words like `implement', `demonstrate', `show',
%% `prove'.
%
%% For example:
%
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item[\bf Good] The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a
%%         management system for network switches;
%% \end{itemize}
%% is much better than:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item[\bf Bad] The aim of this project is to investigate management
%%         systems for network switches.
%% \end{itemize}
%
%% In the second case there is no idea of how much work is involved, and
%% you will never know whether you have finished. You and your supervisor
%% (and the markers of your project) may have very different ideas about
%% what such an `investigation' involves. Of course, it is possible that
%% the task you set yourself is not achievable, but if you are clear from
%% the outset this is less likely, and will more easily be corrected.


\section*{3. Proposed Solution}

%%% HOW

% plan:
%  * find papers about generating loop invariants
%  * read and understand them (out: bibliography)
%  * compare different methods of invariant generation (out: section in report) [ 70's vs. Modern techniques ] ( 2 weeks )
%  * read and understand the Whiley compiler ( 1 weel )
%  * write priminaly report ( est: 2 weeks )
%  * choose a small test project to compare the end-results with (e.g. game of tic-tac-toe) ( est: 1 week )
%  * design a modular system to enable loop invariant generation (out: design documents) ( est: 1 week )
%  * Implement the simplest loop invariant generator (out: code) ( est: 2 weeks )
%  * refactor sample project to use new generator (out: code) (est: 1 week)
%  * write report (out: report ) (est: 1 month )
%  * give presentation of work (out: presentation ) (est: 3 weeks)
%
%  note: accompany each invariant generator with a sample of before & after

The literature for loop invariants describe some techniques to generate
invariants from static analysis or mutating the post-condition and a 
combination. The first step of this project would be to survey the techniques
in the literature for techniques that can be translated to the Whiley setting.
During this time a review of the Whiley language, compiler and theorem prover
will be necessary to understand how these techniques would fit in.

From the identified techniques some of them will be implemented into the
Whiley language with the aim to remove the burden of a class of simple invariants,
such as keeping the index within bounds of array.
Each generator and targeted simple invariants will require already existing
or new sample code to verify that the changes to Whiley have been successful.

Below is an itemized list of an estimation of each section of the project.
The time allocated of the twenty-five weeks from proposal hand-in to
final report is due is allocated as such. 

% TODO: finalize how this looks
\begin{itemize}
    \item Survey loop invariant literature for report (est: 2 weeks) 
    \item Review the Whiley language and tools (est: 2 weeks)
    \item Identify appropriate loop invariant generator methods (est: 2 weeks)
    \item Write preliminary report (est: 2 weeks)
    \item Implement loop invariant generators identified (est: 8 weeks)
    \item Experiment with loop invariant generator's practical use (est: 2 weeks)
    \item Write final report (est: 3 weeks)
    \item Write and present the final presentation (est: 3 weeks)
\end{itemize}

%%% Given text
%% In this section you will explain how solve the problem, that is, how
%% you intend to carry the project out. At this early stage you need to
%% be both clear about what you are going to do and flexible enough to
%% adapt to changing circumstances. Making an early plan will not prevent
%% you from running into trouble, but it will help you identify possible
%% problems early. For example, if you intended to run an experiment in
%% HCI, you might realise early on that there would be problems gathering
%% sufficient data to get reliable results, and that you should re-design
%% your experiment.
%
%% Part of the planning process involves producing a timetable for when
%% the work is actually going to be done.
%
%% Each part of the project should produce some output. For example you
%% might plan on spending two weeks on background reading: the output of
%% this will be a bibliography, and a possibly a literature survey for
%% your report. Indeed, if you take the advice given above about having
%% specific, measurable goals, you should describe this part of your
%% project as:
%
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item[\bf Good] Produce bibliography (est: 2 weeks)
%% \end{itemize}
%% rather than
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item[\bf Bad] Background reading (est: 2 weeks)
%% \end{itemize}
%
%% Note that the methodology you outline here is dependent upon the type
%% of project and engineering area. You must talk to your supervisor
%% about this.

\section*{4. Evaluating your Solution}

%%% WITH

% comparing the code reduction in sample programs to see how much is saved
% with using the generators
% * compare performance ?
% * evaluate how strong / buggy / crashy the new generators are

The project is evaluated in how it has reduced the burden for a Whiley programmer.
The main measure to quantify the change will be a comparison of the code required
to specify a problem with and without the generated invariants.
Other metrics will be considered while evaluating the project are 
the success rate of the generators to provide a valid loop invariant.

%%% Given text
%% In this section you will explain how you will evaluate your solution
%% once you have built it. The method of evaluation will be domain
%% specific. Your supervisor should provide guidance as to what is an
%% appropriate form of evaluation. For example, user testing for a HCI
%% project or performance measurement for a Network Engineering project.

\section*{5. Resource Requirements}

% resources:
%   * a computer
%   * access to food
%   * access to the literature
%   * a line of communication to the main developer of Whiley

It is assumed that the majority of the resources that are required are already being
provided by Victoria University of Wellington.
This includes the access to a workstation computer with software for Java development
and access to literature on the topics of software verification
and generating loop invariants.
An optional resource that would help the project would be communication
with Whiley's core developer, David J. Pearce.
No other resources have been identified.


%%% Given text
%% In this section you will detail any resource requirements such as
%% hardware, software or access to subjects.
