This assignment addresses course learning objectives:

    Function effectively in a team in a variety of roles. 

using the recruitment exercise for the ENGR 301 projects as the subject.
In the recruitment exercise you have been asked to form selection panels and consider aspects of communication between applicants and panel.
The first assignment is to write a short report on your personal experiences in the recruitment exercise, focussing on communication and functioning in a team.
Aspects of communication and team roles you should give thought to are:

 *  verbal communication, both written and oral, and both applicant and panel.
 *  nonverbal communication, both applicant and panel.
 *  conflict resolution within the panel.
 *  the asymmetry between applicants and panel (e.g. in numbers, knowledge, power, communication, etc.) 

Selection panels are encouraged to communicate with their project's clients for more information.
Such communication is a legitimate subject for examination in the report.

Some suggested questions which might be reflected upon in the assignment are:

 *  What was it like to be on the other side of the table?
    - hetic
    - 
 *  What where the good things and the bad things you saw in the Project Applications you read?
    - having only one canidate that placed our project in top 3 we read all the applications for other projects on their CVs
    - Good: gems that would give some insight of what the person is like, such as showing some passion for external acticities or quick stories.
    - Bad: very loose reasoning about why they wanted to be in a project, such as 'I played a card game once'
    - Ugly: 
 *  What were the good things and bad things you observed during the interviews?
 *  Were there any insights or realisations which you recall in particular?
 *  How were panel discussions conducted, particularly when there were disagreements?
 *  How did the panel communicate with the applicants
 *  What was it that, in hindsight, the panel communicated? 
    - we had a desire for a candidate that is up for learning new tools and skills
    - we did not communicate the importanace of critical thinking to the project for compare & contrasting different solutions

notes:
 * hard to hold impressions of interviewees with the fast pace between interviews
 * had 3 no-shows
    - used downtime to look for them
    - discuss how we are going
 * had 2 conflicts of interest
    - afterwards Peter was discussing what would of happened if I did not abstane from 
    - had to sit out of two interviews, only had 3 of us on the panel and put more
    - how well did I handle it? Johnathan was surprise
        - moved myself physically away from the table
        - 
 * insights
    - charisma makes a large difference in how you view someone
    -
