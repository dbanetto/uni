The Basin Reserve flyover was a proposed solution to alleviate the congestion between Wellington City, New Zealand,
and the eastern suburbs of Wellington.
Its proposed changes were primarily to add a flyover bridge from the Mt. Victoria tunnel to the
National War Memorial Park underpass [@basin_options_summary], see figure 1 for more detail.
These changes are to improve westward traffic heading to the motorway.
This project was one component of a greater project to improve the transport of Wellington region [@northern_corridor],
the Wellington Northern Corridor project.
During the planning of this project the National War Memorial area was being renovated for the 100th Gallopoli Remembrance.
These projects were managed by the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) [@treasury_exp_2016],
the transport arm of the New Zealand Government.

A flyover at the Basin Reserve was not the only option open to the NZTA to choose [@basin_options_report].
They had a range of options with three main themes: a flyover stretching the length of the Basin Reserve ; 
a tunnel the length of the Basin Reserve ; and, a reconfiguration of the street layout
with additional intersections [@basin_options_report].
Each option was tested against how well they alleviate the vehicle traffic of all use cases through
the Basin Reserve as well as promoting pedestrians and cyclists to easily move through the area.
A key metric used was to check the improvements of East-West and North-South traffic flow without
putting any of the services dependent on the Basin Reserve at a disadvantage, such as the Wellington Central Hospital to the
south and the schools to the east and south.

The Basin Reserve area includes a range of heritage sites and even the grounds
itself is a registered heritage area since 1998 [@basin_heritage].
Other heritage sites around the Basin Reserve that would be impacted include
Government House, official residence of the Governor General of New Zealand,
and the Home of Compassion Cr√®che, New Zealand's first dedicated child day-care centre [@creche].
These heritage sites have continually been vocally protected by community since the 1960's and today
with the 'Save the Basin' group [@basin_heritage][@save_basin].

The Basin Reserve flyover failed during the proposal phase of the project.
It failed to meet the standards of a Notice of Requirement (NOR) of the resources it needs to complete the project.
A Notice of Requirement is a process set out in the Resource Management Act that air marks the resources
for the project, such as land, while a decision about the proposal is being made by authorities,
such as the local council or the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) [@rma_nor].
The Resource Management Act is set out to formalise the process of allocating natural and physical resources
to promote the sustainable management these resources [@rma_act].
In this case it was handled by the EPA since the Basin Flyover is classified to be of national significance since
it is a part of the Wellington Northern Corridor project [@rma_nor][@basin_options_report].
The project failed the NOR due to a range of failings from not adequately mitigating impact on the amenity and heritage
of the Basin Reserve area and having an unclear rational in choosing a flyover over the
other options [@basin_options_report][@epa_report_judgement].

# Discussion
<!--
 - this was due to multiple failures to meet the requirements of the RMA
    - subset of these failtuers are: alteratives & hertiage site

    - alternatives 
        - "methodology,  particularly  the  need  for transparency and replicability, is important" [1273]
        - "it was not clear how criteria were weighted and the reason for any weighting.
           This made the process somewhat confusing and difficult to follow.  
           It also meant that the process could not be replicated" [1274]
        - section: 171(1) Whether adequate consideration has been given to alternative sites, routes & methods

        - highlights the requirement of transprancy when using finite resources like Land, city space, culture, anemity

    - hertiage sites
        - section 6(f) recongise & provide for protection of historic heritage from inappropriate development
        - public outcry tipped the balance & defended the Basin
        - King Salmon, case applied to '*inappropriate* development' 
        - test-cricket status of the Basin Reserve venue [1259]

         - highlights the importance of history and the community support for the site

## Heritage and Cultural Significance
<!-- heritage -->

The Basin Reserve flyover does not directly impact any heritage site in the
area but effects how they are viewed.
However, the flyover would dominate the skyline of the historic area with its size and obstruct
amenity [@epa_report_heritage].
It is this disruption to the local landscape which lead to the formation of
'Save the Basin' a group that strongly opposes the flyover.
The EPA also agreed that the flyover would cause a considerable impact on
the historic area of the Basin Reserve by obstructing the open spaces
and breaking visual links between historic sites in the area [@epa_report_heritage].

It is a principle of the Resource Management Act to protect historic locations
of national importance from inappropriate development [@rma_act].
The Basin Reserve area has been a registered heritage site since 1998
[@basin_heritage] and the surrounding area has a high density of heritage
buildings.
It is also a site of national importance due to its history as a proposed
inner-city dock in 1840 and a cricket ground since 1876 [@basin_heritage].
However, with the flyover presents a risk to using the Basin Reserve as 
test cricket ground as the raised vehicles' noise and movement would
be a distraction to players and the spectators alike [@epa_report_heritage].
This would also be extend to be a potential risk to other events open air
events such as Robbie William's 2015 concert.

Making changes to a heritage site is always going to difficult with community
push-back.
For the Basin Reserve flyover the community consolation resulted in such an
overwhelming negative response that the EPA was clear that there was a major 
issue with the protection of the heritage of the area [@epa_report_heritage].
In the same area there was the development of the National War Memorial park 
that has greater national importance but still managed to balance the heritage
and cultural significance, even enhancing it.
For future project the lessons taken from how cultural and heritage value was 
handled and valued needs to be improved. 
The most direct way to achieve this would be to get community consultation and 
evaluate the risk of a community backlash on the grounds of heritage could derail
an entire project given its significance.

## Transparency in selection
<!-- selection transpranecy -->

An aspect that lead to the failure of the proposal for the Basin Reserve Flyover was that the process to decide
the approach was unreproducible and not transparent [@epa_report_alt].
Since the flyover will have an adverse effect on its environment NZTA is required to make considerations of alternatives 
under the Resource Management Act[@rma_act].
The Basin Reserve project had a total of six success criteria for the design of the solution.
They covered: local environment, land use, cost and time, local movement, passenger transport and traffic strategy.
From 2001 to 2011 NZTA had gone through 73 alternatives and narrowed it down to a shortlist of seven options to be considered with
the three themes [@basin_options_report].
Though the RMA does not test for quantity of alternatives considered but the quality of the analysis used to determine which
option will best suit the objectives of the project and the goals of the RMA.
The options were further reduced to two options for public consultation.
Both of these options are alternatives of the same theme of a flyover stretching the length of the Basin Reserve.

A common metric to decide on an option is looking at the cost and the ratio to its benefit.
With NZTA's report on the finial seven options included the cost and benefit ratios.
Where a tunnel would cost between \$160m to \$220m with a cost-to-benefit ratio between 0.8 to 0.9,
a change in the roads would cost between \$40m to \$50m with a cost-to-benefit ratio between 1.4 to 1.6,and a
flyover had a projected cost between \$75m and \$100m with a cost-to-benefit ratio between 1.1 to 1.2 [@basin_options_report].
From these ratios alone they show that the change in roads have the most benefit and the lowest total cost.
This is in contrast to what NZTA choose with the Flyover options chosen for public consultation [@basin_options_summary].
NZTA applied a matrix of criteria that is aligned with the design criteria, it also explicitly included the impact on
the built heritage of the surrounding area.

With the given metrics the final options were cut down to flyover based alternatives.
Reconfiguration of the roads had the highest cost-to-benefit ratio due to their
lower cost comparatively but failed to meet most of the traffic goals of the project [@basin_options_report][@epa_report_alt].
The use of tunnels were not used as they give practically the same benefits of a flyover
at double the cost expect in terms of impact on the heritage and amenity of the area.
NZTA notes that if more weighting is given to the impact on the heritage of area the
reconfiguration of the roads would likely be the theme of the chosen option at
the cost of completing all of its traffic improvement objectives [@basin_options_report][@epa_report_alt].

The EPA found that there were inconsistencies when evaluating the range options.
A key observation was that NZTA gave more weighting to the impacts of social and urban design
over the built heritage of the area for no known reason [@epa_report_alt]. 
This is a symptom of a lack of transparency in the evaluation methodology and was a key factor
to the community push back on the final option.
The push back to changes in the Basin Reserve area is not a new occurrence with a similar
situation occurring when making the Basin Reserve a part of State Highway One in the 1960's [@basin_heritage].
Another aspect of the opaque evaluation was the inconsistent use of affordability to dismiss the tunnel options but not others.
In particular this occurred when a tunnel based option was reevaluated against the final option and found the
tunnel was a better option on all fronts except in cost [@epa_report_alt].
For future projects the weighting of community centric metrics should be influenced by the
community of the area or that all weightings are given well reasoned rational for their importance or lack there of.
With this recommendation should lead to more transparent evaluation.
