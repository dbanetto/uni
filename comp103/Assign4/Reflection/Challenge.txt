Do all consumer threads in ThreadChallenge get the same number of elements from the queue. Ie, is the queue fair?
    Why/Why not?
    (Answer this for both Java's ArrayBlockingQueue and your own extended ArrayQueue, if you did it.) 

If not, how could you implement a fair queue?

Neither the ArrayBlockingQueue or ArrayQueueCh are "fair" queues as 
both have a seemingly random distribution of consumed counts.

To implement a fair multi-threaded queue would most likely
require a queue of requests that have asked to take an item and
deal with them in order
