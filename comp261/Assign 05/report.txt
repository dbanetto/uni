Describe what your code does and doesn't do.

It does not implement remove, it does not index the values to another block in leaf nodes

Describe any bugs that you have not been able to resolve.

None known.

Report briefly on the performance of your program - how many block reads and writes were required on average to find a value or to add a new record.

Not the best. Single writes per-block update, some redundant block reads could be
optimized with caching parent on traversal and intercepting read requests with the read value, but deleting cache on write to that block.

Outline how you tested that your program worked.

Loaded host-list.txt.

Tested with test-list.txt and host-list.txt, any missing was inspected with step debugging down the tree.

Also counting the number of entries while iterating all and matched it to length of host-list.txt

Describe any of the extensions you did and discuss the results.

None
