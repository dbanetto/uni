using the recruitment exercise for the ENGR 301 projects as the subject.
In the recruitment exercise you have been asked to form selection panels and consider
aspects of communication between applicants and panel.
The first assignment is to write a short report on your personal experiences in the recruitment exercise,
focussing on communication and functioning in a team.
Aspects of communication and team roles you should give thought to are:

 *  verbal communication, both written and oral, and both applicant and panel.
 *  nonverbal communication, both applicant and panel.
 *  conflict resolution within the panel.
 *  the asymmetry between applicants and panel (e.g. in numbers, knowledge, power, communication, etc.) 

Selection panels are encouraged to communicate with their project's clients for more information.
Such communication is a legitimate subject for examination in the report.

<!-- abstract -->

This case study will describe the recruitment process for Project 6, ADRI, and my
experience through the recruitment process.
Focusing on the communication between applicants and the panel and how the
panel team functioned.
This case study outlines the context in which our panel worked in,
the written communication to the panel via CVs from the applicants
and the oral communication between the panel and interviewees.

<!-- ADD THINGS THAT WILL BE COVERED -->

<!-- describe main issues -->

The panel team for project 6, ADRI Online repository of Arabic digital content,
 Peter Scriven Reuben Puketapu and I.
We had the task of selecting candidates for interviews and ultimately 
The outline for the project describes its purpose in two stages.
The first stage is to investigate a range of open source repository tools and
create a report about the suitability of them.
The second stage is to create tools to deploy the chosen repository with
a range of different tools [@project6outline].
From this outline our panel decided the attributes we
were looking for in an ideal candidate has the willingness to learn a range of new
tools and a bonus would be if they were confident with being able to
teach what they have learnt to their other team members.

<!-- CVs -->

The panel used the CVs given to us to try to identify candidates that displayed
the attributes we identified through written communication.
This was challenged as the project was not a popular choice, with only one candidate with
a direct application to this project.
The consequence of this was we were not reading the CVs to be persuaded by the candidate's
writing but needed to read their applications to other projects
with the mindset of how could their skills and experiences could be transfered and benefit our
project.
However since the candidates are applying for other projects want they are less
likely to list skills relevant to our project unless another project
had similar requirements [@careersnzcv][@engr301interview].
From reading all of the applications there was some common aspects that made a
CV standout.
The main aspect of a standout CV for our panel was not just listing down their skills
but also backed it up with evidence instead of .
This came in the form of either recounting an experience, project or an accomplishment, such as
winning a hackathon.
This evidence based description of their skills were effective in helping
the panel get some insight of their character, where their passions lie and how well they fit
to our key attribute of being willing to learn something entirely new.
The CVs that lacked this quality were harder to judge highly as we had to rely more on the
technical skills listed as basis to evaluate their suitability to project.
This technique is described by different job hunting bodies [@careersnzdescribe] and
is something I will be taking away to improve my own CVs in the future.
The end result of reading the CVs have left a ring of truth to common advice about
aiming for CV for the position you want [@careersnzcv][@careersnzdescribe] and in
the case of our panel it is still useful if your CV is passed around to other positions
you did not aim for to begin with such as our project.

<!-- 
    talk about good & bad points of CVs (written communication)
 *  What where the good things and the bad things you saw in the Project Applications you read?
    -   having only one canidate that placed our project in top 3 we read all the applications for other projects on their CVs
    -   Good: gems that would give some insight of what the person is like, such as showing some passion for external acticities or quick stories.
    -   Bad: very loose reasoning about why they wanted to be in a project, such as 'I played a card game once'

interviews
issue: verbal & non-verbal communication between interviewer & 'ee
       power balance?
-->

These interviews were my first time interviewing a candidate for a position.
From being an interviewer I noticed more about with how interviewees and interviewers
interact then I had being on the other side of the table.
There were two tough constraints on the interviews.
The first was that the majority of our interviewees did not select our project, and
the other was we only had 4 minutes with the interviewee.
Our first constraint lead us to giving each interviewee a brief overview of project's goals
and highlighting the project is focused on learning new tools.
Though we had to forego the time to ask another questions the brief gave us a chance to see
the interviewee's reaction of if they were disinterested or excited.
This was a must know aspect as most candidates did not apply to be on this project.
The brief was prefaced with a friendly introduction of the panel which is a technique
to put the interviewee at ease [@nailinterview2012] and allows us to frame the interview
as more of a conversation then a panel of judges but we also put the note till the
end of the interview to keep this atmosphere.
Taking the notes at the end allowed us to only record what was standout during the interview
and to discuss the panel's overall thoughts on the interview.
However this left answers to individual questions, such as critical ones as team cooperation,
out of the notes.
The most felt consequence of this decision was the following day while updating the
rankings of the candidates.
The notes gave a good indication of who we liked but it lacked the ability to be able
to retrace the steps we came to the decision.
With the loss of these steps we could not reproduce our chain of thought or be able to
differentiate similar candidates.
In hindsight we could of kept the conversation atmosphere with the interviewee with a
panel member taking notes and is a recommended [@nailinterview2012] method to give effective
interviews.
The note taker would have to be mindful of how their action effect the interview, such
as franticly writing down everything the interviewee says might make them more nervous
and harder to interview.
Going through this interview process has highlighted the importance of the interviewers
giving the interviewee a good chance at the interview, with one method being to make
them feel comfortable in a conversation, and the importance for interviewers to take notes
for review later.

needs citations and relating to real world

 *  How did the panel communicate with the applicants
    - verbal:
        - allow them to introduce themselves
        - give a brief overview of the project
        - ask questions about previous team experiences & how they went
        - ask about if they have used any of the tools listed & if they wanted to learn them
    - non-verbal
        - the panel was all engaged with what the candiate was saying
        - to our downfall we only took some very brief notes after the interview, such as "Euphemistic" or "Not keen" to give us some prompt to remember the canidate later
            ( that did not work out too well for me)
 *  What was it that, in hindsight, the panel communicated? 
    - we had a desire for a candidate that is up for learning new tools and skills
    - we did not communicate the importanace of critical thinking to the project for compare & contrasting different solutions
    - that it was OK to not know anything about the tools being used just a willing to learn them & explain them to your team.

<!-- conculsions -->

From this case study I have found places where I can improve as an interviewer and interviewee
as well as confirming advise from supporting agencies.
Reading the CVs of the applicants confirmed the advice[@careersnzdescribe] to not just
list your skills but provide backing evidence and when accompanied by experiences help
to give the interviewer insight into the candidate.
Being on the panel revealed that the interview is a two way street of
interviewer wanting to give the interviewee their best chance to confirm what
the interviewer has read about them in their CV as well as the importance of
notes about the interview for an interviewer.
