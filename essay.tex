\section{Importance of using process models}
% Q: describe the importance of using process models to guide software development

% why we need process modeling
Fail to plan, is a plan to fail. 
As software has increased in complexity and scale of projects increase it
became more apparent that software should be managed and planned differently it was
described as a \emph{Software crisis} \cite{nato:1969}.
``We believe that the only way ahead lies through the steady development of the best existing 
techniques'' \cite{nato:1969} Gill's comments on how to move forward from the
\emph{Software Crisis} which describes a need for more of a engineering approach to software development.
One such endeavour is process modelling.
A process model is a model of how to setup a project with a set of tasks,
such as requirements acquisition or construction, of a similar nature that together form 
the scaffolding of a plan of how to approach to build a project.

\vspace{.1in} % are we allowed to do this?

By using the appropriate process model software development can be guided
through the many stages of creating software with an over-arching idea of how it
should be done. This can range from having static requirements and working
linearly through the development cycle to changing the requirements from week to
week. With the right processing model the software will have the correct tools
to handle what was expected to happen through out the process and give a guide
through the unexpected.

% add more on why it is important and how it guides

% TODO: this needs some reworking
Over the years many process models have been proposed and many variations have
been used and reported one. The process models that will be discussed in this
review is: Waterfall, V-Model, Spiral Model, Phased Development Model and
Extreme programming.

The Waterfall model was proposed in 1970 by Dr. Winston Royce \cite{Waterfall:1970}.
He proposed it as a method to be a guide of steps and processes that together
help to make a larger software project succeed. 
The principle idea behind the Waterfall model is that there are seven stages to
software development cycle and they are to be executed in a sequential order:
System requirements, software requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing and operations.
Each stage ends with some artifacts that the next stage depends on, forcing them
to become static, and builds upon to deliver a product at the end of the process.

% main features of waterfall
The strength of this model lies in the assumptions that the requirements are
well thought out, any foreseeable problems has known solutions to complete the
software.
This lends the model to be more suitable for software projects that have well known
requirements and technology such as porting an application to another platform.
Waterfall also has the benefits of being an easy project to manage with its
clear cut stages of development and equally easy for a new member or external
stakeholder to the team to understand the status of the project.

% covers the weakness of water fall
Conversely the strengths of the model highlights the downsides of the model as
well.
One of the assumptions in the process model is that the requirements at the start of the project is
static and are still meet the clients needs that the project was started for.
Another factor to this weakness is that the model allows for only one delivery of the product to
the client at the end of the whole project, making a possible large time gap from requirements 
gathering with the client to the final delivery to the client which has the risk of not being 
what the client had in mind during the initial phases of the project.
