% Case Study: Communication and Teamwork

<!--
using the recruitment exercise for the ENGR 301 projects as the subject.
In the recruitment exercise you have been asked to form selection panels and consider
aspects of communication between applicants and panel.
The first assignment is to write a short report on your personal experiences in the recruitment exercise,
focussing on communication and functioning in a team.
Aspects of communication and team roles you should give thought to are:

 *  verbal communication, both written and oral, and both applicant and panel.
 *  nonverbal communication, both applicant and panel.
 *  conflict resolution within the panel.
 *  the asymmetry between applicants and panel (e.g. in numbers, knowledge, power, communication, etc.) 

Selection panels are encouraged to communicate with their project's clients for more information.
Such communication is a legitimate subject for examination in the report.

<!-- abstract -->

This case study will describe the recruitment process for Project 6, ADRI, and my
experience through the recruitment process.
Focusing on the communication between applicants and the panel and how the
panel team functioned.
<!-- ADD THINGS THAT WILL BE COVERED -->

<!-- describe main issues -->

The panel team for project 6, ADRI Online repository of Arabic digital content,
 Peter Scriven Reuben Puketapu and I.
We had the task of selecting candidates for interviews and ultimately 
The outline for the project describes its purpose in two stages.
The first stage is to investigate a range of open source repository tools and
create a report about the suitability of them.
The second stage is to create tools to deploy the chosen repository with
a range of different tools.
From this outline our panel decided the attributes we
were looking for in an ideal candidates is the willingness to learn a range of new
tools and a bonus would be if they were confident with being able to
teach what they have learnt to other team members.

<!-- CVs -->

The panel used the CVs given to us to try to identify candidates that displayed
the attributes we identified through written communication.
This was challenged as the project was not a popular choice, with only one candidate with
a direct application to this project.
The consequence of this was we needed to read candidate's applications to other projects
with the mindset of how could their skills and experiences could be transfered and benefit our
project.
For example a candidate was successful possum hunter but that is not as transferable
to our project as someone else with a passion for other cultures.
However since the candidates are applying for other projects want they are less
likely to list skills relevant to our project unless another project
had similar requirements [@careersnzcv][@engr301interview].
<!-- review down -->
From reading all of the applications there was some common aspects that made a
CV standout and conversely some that moved CV the down the rankings.
A common aspect of a standout CV was not just listing down their skills
but also backed it up with evidence.
This came in the form of either recounting an experience, project or an accomplishment, such as
winning a hackathon.
This evidence based description of their skills were effective in helping
the panel get some insight of their character, where their passions lie and how well they fit
to our key attribute of being willing to learn something entirely new.
The CVs that lacked this quality were harder to judge highly as we had to rely more on the
technical skills listed as basis to evaluate their suitability to project.
The end result of reading the CVs have left a ring of truth to common advice about
aiming for CV for the position you want [@careersnzcv][@careersnzdescribe] and in
the case of our panel it is still useful if your CV is passed around to other positions
you did not aim for to begin with.

<!-- 
    talk about good & bad points of CVs (written communication)
 *  What where the good things and the bad things you saw in the Project Applications you read?
    -   having only one canidate that placed our project in top 3 we read all the applications for other projects on their CVs
    -   Good: gems that would give some insight of what the person is like, such as showing some passion for external acticities or quick stories.
    -   Bad: very loose reasoning about why they wanted to be in a project, such as 'I played a card game once'
-->

<!-- interviews -->

These interviews were my first time interviewing a candidate for a position.
From being an interviewer I noticed more about with how interviewees and interviewers
interact then I had being on the other side of the table.
A majority of our interviewees did not select our project so our panel decided
to brief description of the project, which included our expectations of a member of the
project.
One of the most important details I found was the panel comes to the interview
with a set of attributes that they want to confirm that the interviewee has given
that their CV outlined them.
This puts the interviewee at a disadvantage with trying to meet these hidden attributes
and shows the power advantage the interviewers has.
Our panel tried to mitigate this in the brief of the project we gave to our interviewees.
In hindsight this mitigation might not of been fair as we hoped for as we dumping
these expectations onto them during the interview with no time to prepare for them,
although the ability to react could be an attribute we are looking for.
From past experience we knew the interviews were probably nervous so we started it
by introducing ourselves to help them be at ease.
This had the aim to set a welcoming atmosphere which is commonly advised [@nailinterview2012]. 
We attempted to carry this atmosphere by making the interview more of a
conversation about the project and the interviewee's experiences then
drilling them with questions. 
A side-effect of this is we did not take notes during the interviews but
took holistic notes at the end of the interview.
These notes reflected the entire interview more then answers to individual questions.
The main consequence of this was it became a lot harder to retrace our
decision process of how we came to the suitability of the candidate since we lost
our intermediate steps.
The lack of notes did also hurt our ability to refine our selection after the interviews
as it become more difficult when reviewing the candidates.
In hindsight this was less fair to the candidates that did not standout positively or negatively
as they were more difficult to recall and to give a judgement afterwards.
From this I would recommend more notes then just a holistic description

needs citations and relating to real world

 *  How did the panel communicate with the applicants
    - verbal:
        - allow them to introduce themselves
        - give a brief overview of the project
        - ask questions about previous team experiences & how they went
        - ask about if they have used any of the tools listed & if they wanted to learn them
    - non-verbal
        - the panel was all engaged with what the candiate was saying
        - to our downfall we only took some very brief notes after the interview, such as "Euphemistic" or "Not keen" to give us some prompt to remember the canidate later
            ( that did not work out too well for me)
 *  What was it that, in hindsight, the panel communicated? 
    - we had a desire for a candidate that is up for learning new tools and skills
    - we did not communicate the importanace of critical thinking to the project for compare & contrasting different solutions
    - that it was OK to not know anything about the tools being used just a willing to learn them & explain them to your team.

<!-- conflict of interest
During the interviews I had two interviewees that were conflicts of interest.
